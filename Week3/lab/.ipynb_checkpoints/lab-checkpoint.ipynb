    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Various types of algorithms and computation methods are used in the supervised learning process. Below are some of the common types of supervised learning algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regression\n",
    "Regression is used to understand the relationship between dependant and independent variables. Moreover, it is a type of supervised learning that learns from labelled data sets to predict continuous output for different data in an algorithm. It is believed to be widely used in scenarios where the output needs to be a finite value.\n",
    "There two types of regression; Linear Regression and Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Naive Bayes\n",
    "A Naive Bayes algorithm is used for large datasets. The approach works on the fundamental that every programme in the algorithm works independently. This means that the presence of one feature will not impact the other. Generally, it is used in text classification, recommendation systems, and others. There are different types of Naive Bayes models, and the decision tree remains the most popular among business organizations. A decision tree is a unique supervised learning algorithm structurally resembling a flowchart. However, they fundamentally perform different roles and responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Classification\n",
    "It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that accurately assigns data into different categories or classes. It recognizes specific entities and analyses them to conclude where those entities must be categorized. Some of the classification algorithms are as follows: K-nearest neighbor, Random forest, Support vector machines, Decision tree ,Linear classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Neutral networks\n",
    "This type of supervised learning algorithm is used to group or categorize raw data. In addition, it is used for finding a pattern or interpreting sensory data. However, the algorithm requires numerous amounts of computation resources. As a result, its uses are constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Random forest\n",
    "A random forest algorithm is often called an ensemble method because it combines different supervised learning methods to conclude. Moreover, it uses many decision trees to output the classification of individual trees. As a result, it is widely used across industries.\n"
