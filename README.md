## Course Description

The goal of this is to give an introduction to and hands on experience with all phases of the data science process using real data and modern tools. Topics that will be covered include data formats, loading, cleaning, data storage in relational & non-relational stores and data visualization.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion, I was able to:

●	Understand conceptually the basics of machine learning like hypothesis space, probability, classifier, dimensionality reduction, cross validation etc.
●	Be introduced to basic unsupervised learning methods, such as clustering
●	Learn a few key supervised learning techniques. Examples include decision trees, linear and logistic regression, Bayesian classifiers, Support Vector Machines
●	Apply the learned techniques to some analytics problem through a project.
